# 6pp - postcode database
Dutch 6PP database - provincie, plaats, postcode, straatnaam, latitude, longitude

This repo contains a Dutch geolocation dataset. Most importantly it contains 6PP (4 numbers, and 2 characters) zipcode data, mapped to adresses and latitude/longitude data. Data is available in csv format but feel free to contact me if you require it in any other format.

Two important remarks, the location data is in 4PP granularity, and the list of zipcode is probably not entirely complete anymore.
